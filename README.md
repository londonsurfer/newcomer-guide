# Newcomer to London Guide - From the plane to your first job

Hope this guide helps someone get a job in London, if it does, you can send thanks to `thanks@alexanderkustov.com` or a pint of your favorite beverage will also do. Feel free to update this guide with better reccomendations or suggest translatations, through the same e-mail or just via Github.

### 0 - Language matters
Before you even consider the remote possibility of moving to London, you need a good grasp of English.

No one here will expect the full British accent, or any knowledge of Shakespeare literature, but if you can't communicate with your collegues and employers, if you won't be able to explain why should anyone hire you, unfortunately it's going to be tough.

There are still plenty of local communities from any country in the world, running local restaurants and almost serve entirely local clientele, but it is not the general rule.

So just before you decide to buy your plane tickets, try to brush as much as you can your conversational English.

### 2 - Accomodation first
Location, location, location. Where you live will impact a lot, be it how much you spend on rent, how far it is to get your job and a lot of other factors. Choosing accomodation even for Londoners is still a big problem. Rent is getting quite costly in central areas, there is quite a lot of possible scams for newcomers and quite a few options remaining. 

I will hopefully expand this guide to look at these options with more detail but for now, if it's your first month in London, reach to your friends who might live here and ask for their suggestions, if that does not work rely on Airbnb or Hostels for at least the first 2 weeks. Once you land in one of them it will be much easier to assess 


### 4 - Basics for London Survival

There is no order in getting these, but they are all important for getting a job, and really continual survival in London.

#### Proof of Adress
If you have a rental contract, you are lucky, if you have a bill for Gas/Electricity/Water you are also lucky, bank bills work as a charm.
If you can change your home country bank, to your London Adress, even if its a temporary adress it might work, especially if it's a bank that has representation in the country (barclays, santander). If you can open a Bank Account ASAP and happen to be an EU citizen, they sometime will not ask for many documents to prove you live here or there, and usually are okay if you say you live with a friend.

An alternative to showcasing your proof of adress sometimes is a letter from a library. If you have a local library, register as soon as possible with it and if it's not a small one they will send you a card by mail. Another chance for getting proof of Adress


####  National Insurance Number
Call the National Insurance number, as soon as you arrive in your first accomodation and you know the complete adress. They will ask you a few questions like your name, nationality, current adress, why do you want a national insurance number (which the answer should be to work here) and they should give you a reference number and a date to go to your nearest job centre.
You will have to go to an interview, they will ask for a document (passport, national identity card) and a proof of adress. Sometimes you don't have to show it, has happened to some of my friends, but it's really unusual. But if you don't have it yet, because nothing still arrived don't be afraid to go to the interview anyway, it will last 10 minutes, but the waiting time might be more. After filling the paperwork they will not tell your NI directly, they will just send it to your adress in 2 weeks. If you have changed accomodation by then do not worry, you can call a number again to ask them, or to resend it to any other adress.

####  Bank Account
If you have a branch of any bank near you, just go directly and ask what do you need to book an interview to open a Basic Account, and if you are from EU, what documents do you need to show. If they tell you you need proof of adress, ask them again if there is no special rules for EU citizens, some banks do not need proof of adress (Lloyds, Halifax) but it really depends on the guy at the counter and not on the bank.
Which Bank, does not matter at this point, you can always switch to anything that you like after you get your first salary, just be sure the bank does not charge you any fees.
After getting this the previous items will be easier of course. 
An alternative to getting a bank account in a branch for now is an App called Monese, you download it to your phone, you take some pics of your documents and in 5 minutes you should have a bank account through them, the deal breakers is that they charge fees, monthly and on some withdrawals which is not ideal, but still if you need to get paid quickly, it might be worth it. Just read all of their terms.
