## Newcomer to London Guide - From the plane to your 

Hope this guide helps someone get a job in London, if it does, you can send thanks to `thanks@alexanderkustov.com` or a pint of your favorite beverage will also do. Feel free to update this guide with better recommendations or suggest translations, through the same e-mail or just via Github.

### Language matters
Before you even consider the remote possibility of moving to London, you need a good grasp of English.

No one here will expect the full British accent or any knowledge of Shakespeare literature, but you need to communicate with your colleagues and employers. If you won't be able to explain why should anyone hire you, unfortunately, it's going to be tough.

There are still plenty of local communities from any country, running local business and almost serve entirely alike clientele, but it is not the general rule.

So just before you decide to buy your plane tickets, try to brush as much as you can your conversational English.

### Accommodation first
Location, location, location. Where you live will impact a lot, be it how much you spend on rent, how far it is to get your job and a lot of other factors. 

Choosing accommodation even for professional Londoners is still a big problem. Rent is getting quite costly in central areas, there is quite a lot of possible scams for newcomers. Tube will cost around £180 a month if you are lucky, rent can be found around £200 per week in a shared situation, but do not expect a lot of luxury, a studio might be around £1200 if you are lucky to find it in Zone 2 or 3, but that all changes on a weekly basis.

I will hopefully expand this guide to look at these options with more detail but for now, if it's your first month in London, reach to your friends who live here and ask for their suggestions, if you can crash their couch for a week, and another couch for another week that will be a lifesaver.
If that does not work rely on Airbnb or Hostels for at least the first 2 weeks. Once you land in one of them it will be much easier to assess your future options, once you have accomodation for the first 2 weeks first seek a job, after it seek a closer flat to your job. Or something that will not require a long commute.

### Basics for London Survival

There is no order in getting these, but they are all important for getting a job, and really just survival in London.

#### Proof of Adress
If you have a rental contract, you are lucky, if you have a bill for Gas/Electricity/Water you are also lucky, bank bills work like a charm.
If you can change your home country bank, to your London adress, even if its a temporary address it might work, especially if it's a bank that has representation in the country (Barclays, Santander). If you can open a Bank Account ASAP and happen to be an EU citizen, they sometime will not ask for many documents to prove you live here, and usually are okay if you say you live with a friend.

An alternative to showcasing your proof of address sometimes is a letter from a library. If you have a local library, register as soon as possible with it and if it's not a small one they will send you a card by mail. Another chance for getting proof of Adress will be getting anyone who is a home owner to say you are officially renting or staying with them. 

Any way you choose will help during the first few months, but getting a Bank Account will solve it for the future occasions.


####  National Insurance Number
Call the National Insurance number, as soon as you arrive in your first accommodation and you know the complete address. They will ask you a few questions like your name, nationality, current address, why do you want a national insurance number (which the answer should be to work here) and they should give you a reference number and a date to go to your nearest job centre.
You will have to go to an interview, they will ask for a document (passport, national identity card) and a proof of address. Sometimes you don't have to show it, has happened to some of my friends, but it's really unusual. But if you don't have it yet because nothing still arrived don't be afraid to go to the interview anyway, it will last 10 minutes, but the waiting time might be more. After filling the paperwork they will not tell your NI directly, they will just send it to your address in 2 weeks. If you have changed accommodation by then do not worry, you can call a number again to ask them, or to resend it to any other address.

####  Bank Account
If you have a branch of any bank near you, just go directly and ask what do you need to book an interview to open a Basic Account, and if you are from EU, what documents do you need to show. If they tell  that you need proof of address, ask them again if there are no special rules for EU citizens, some banks do not need proof of address (Lloyds, Halifax) but it really depends on the guy at the counter and not on the bank.
Which Bank, does not matter at this point, you can always switch to anything that you like after you get your first salary, just be sure the bank does not charge you any fees.
After getting this the previous items will be easier of course. 
An alternative to getting a bank account in a branch, for now, is an App called Money, you download it to your phone, you take some pics of your documents and in 5 minutes you should have a bank account through them, the deal breakers is that they charge fees, monthly and on some withdrawals which are not ideal, but still if you need to get paid quickly, it might be worth it. Just read all of their terms.

### Job Hunting
A basic CV is required, but just being at the right time in the right place will work wonders. A few ways of approaching this might be through recruitment agencies, through sites and apps that are similar to recruitment agencies, that hire non qualified staff almost on a daily/shift basis, through normal job sites, or through networking groups or social groups on linkedin, facebook.

Just try to avoid at all cost jobs that promise you flexible work hours, and only pay by commission of sales, that is not the job that will help you pay the first few bills. A lot of those will seem eager to hire you but try to use common sense.

### Professional Job Hunting
You probably have more qualifications or aspirations than your first set of jobs you encounter through agencies or apps, try to always be better in your life, be it your London life or actual life, than you were the day before. 

Do not get stuck to one job as it's your only thing. London is synonymous with opportunities.
